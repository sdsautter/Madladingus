What's with all the fuss

Two adjective1 men were walking down the street one day when all of a sudden they came across a noun1 and another noun2. The first man thought that noun1 was vastly superior than noun2. Unfortunately, the first man is a adjective2 descriptionOfPerson1, if you know what I mean, so lets call him properNoun1. The second man, a adjective2 descriptionOfPerson2 man with a knack for existing, much like a properNoun2 would, verbed1 up to the noun2, and with great enthusiasm verbalized1, "My noun3, I have never seen such beauty like this perfect specimen of a noun2 in all my life. It reminds me of what my familyMember1 had when I was young." 

properNoun1 said, "that may be the case, but my familyMember2 had a noun1 just like this one when I was young, and noun1s are so much moreAdjective1 than noun2ses." <italics> Don't forget that this man is a adjective2 descriptionOfPerson1.</italics> "And further more," the properNoun1 continues while verbing1 down the street, "this noun1 has a certain quality about it. A quality that shines in both it's subjective beauty, like a noun4 verbing2 in a place1, and it's objective worth."

With the vigor of number1 properNoun2 verbalized2, "That's the most adjective3 thing I've ever heard, but what else would you expect from a descriptionOfPerson1 such as yourself." ProperNoun2 persisted, "Even a noun3 would see that this noun2 is a better find than that noun1. This noun2 is adjective4, and that noun1 is adjective5. If you were to verb1 with something, would you rather it be adjective4 or adjective5? Tha-"

"-adjective5," interrupted properNoun1.

properNoun2 fainted, hitting the ground like a stack of verbing3 nounsPlural2
