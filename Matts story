What's with all the fuss

Two adjective(1)tall men were walking down the street one day when all of a sudden they came across a noun1(dong) and a noun2(scrote). The first man thought that noun1(dong) was vastly superior than noun2(scrote). Unfortunately, the first man is a adjective2(stanky) descriptionOfPerson1(slut), if you know what I mean, so lets call him properNoun1(Scott). The second man, a adjective3(dirty) descriptionOfPerson2(magician) man with a knack for existing, much like a properNoun2(Tammy) would, verbed1(lathered) up to the noun2(scrote), and with great enthusiasm verbalized1(exclaimed), "My noun3(blender), I have never seen such beauty like this perfect specimen of a noun2(scrote) in all my life. It reminds me of what my familyMember1(uncle) had when I was young." 

properNoun1(Scott) said, "that may be the case, but my familyMember2(step-mother) had a noun1(dong) just like this one when I was young, and noun1(dong)s are so much moreAdjective1(more grotesque) than noun2(scrote)ses." <italics> Don't forget that this man is a adjective2(stanky) descriptionOfPerson1(slut).</italics> "And further more," the properNoun1(Scott) continues while verbing1(crunching) down the street, "this noun1(dong) has a certain quality about it. A quality that shines in both it's subjective beauty, like a noun4(tongue) verbing2(splitting) in a place1(playground), and it's objective worth."

With the vigor of number1(7) nounPlural(ducks) properNoun2 (Tammy) verbalized2(grunted), "That's the most adjective3(slippery) thing I've ever heard, but what else would you expect from a descriptionOfPerson1(slut) such as yourself." ProperNoun2(Tammy) persisted, "Even a noun3(blender) would see that this noun2(scrote) is a better find than that noun1(dong). This noun2(scrote) is adjective4(nippley), and that noun1(dong) is adjective5(strong). If you were to verb1(slaughter) with something, would you rather it be adjective4(nippley) or adjective5(strong)? Tha-"

"-adjective5(strong)," interrupted properNoun1(Scott).

properNoun2(Tammy) fainted, hitting the ground like a stack of verbing3(trampling) nounsPlural2(buttholes).
